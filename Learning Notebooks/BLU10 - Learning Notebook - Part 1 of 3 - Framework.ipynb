    "# 1 Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation Systems (RS) are software systems that recommend items to users, that they might like.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by learning the main components of an RS.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Recommender Sytems Framework](../media/recommender_systems_framework.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Fig.1 - RS framework with a community, plus the basic and extended models.*\n",
    "\n",
    "We refer back to this framework frequently throughout the specialization, but for now, let's drill down into each component.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Users\n",
    "\n",
    "The *consumers* or people, denoted by $U = \\{u_0, u_1, ..., u_m\\}$, where $m \\in \\mathbb{N_0}$ and cardinality $\\left\\vert{U}\\right\\vert = m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We reserve the indexing letters $u$ and $v$ to denote generic individual users.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Items\n",
    "\n",
    "The *products* or things, a set $I = \\{i_0, i_1, ..., i_n\\}$, with $n \\in \\mathbb{N_0}$ and number of elements $\\left\\vert{I}\\right\\vert = n$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The indexing letters for letters for items are $i$, $j$ and $l$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Community\n",
    "\n",
    "Users and items together form a shared space in which user opinions make sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "The space of all possible ($u$, $i$) pairs is given by $U \\times I = \\{(u_0, i_0), (u_0, i_1), ..., (u_0, i_n), ..., (u_m, i_n)\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting set $U \\times I$ contains $\\left\\vert{U}\\right\\vert * \\left\\vert{I}\\right\\vert = m * n$ possible combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.4 Ratings\n",
    "\n",
    "The *transactions* or opinions, provided by the users about the items.\n",
    "\n",
    "We write the set $R = \\{r_{u_0, i_0}, ..., r_{u_m, i_n}\\}$, where each rating $r_{u, i}$ corresponds to a user-item pair $(u, i) \\in U \\times I$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use $R'$ for the set of all recorded ratings, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Any user $u \\in U$ can make no more than one rating $r_{u, i}$ for a particular item $i \\in I$.\n",
    "* Any user $u \\in U$ is free to rate, or not, any number of items $i \\in I$, including none.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, the set of stored ratings $R' \\subseteq R$. (The set of stored ratings $R'$ is a subset of the set containing all possible ratings $R$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, if $R'$ is not a strict subset of $R$, i.e., if $R' \\subset R$, you don't need an RS.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.5 Base model\n",
    "\n",
    "The essential components, known as the fundamental entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.6 Profiles\n",
    "\n",
    "Profiles are a collection of objects (users or items, in our framework) and their attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the set of attributes $A = \\{a_0, ..., a_r\\}$, where $r \\in \\mathbb{N_0}$. Let be $A$ an arbitrary set of item attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can define profiles $P = \\{p_{i_0, a_0}, ..., p_{i_n, a_r}\\}$, where $(i, a) \\in I \\times A$ and values $p_{i, a}$ indicate the presence of $a$ in $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let be $B$ be an arbitrary set of user characteristics, and we can apply the same reasoning to build user profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, item profiles contain information about the content of the items, and user profiles are more focused on demographics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.7 User model\n",
    "\n",
    "As introduced above, RS are in the business of matching users and items.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, it's convenient to have user and item profiles in the same attribute space $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user model $M$, defines $M = \\{m_{u_0, a_0}, ..., m_{u_m, a_r}\\}$, for $(u, a) \\in U \\times A$, where $A$ is the set of item attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.8 Extended model\n",
    "\n",
    "The extended model layer contains optional components which apply only to particular RS architectures."

    "# 6 Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to fill in the blanks in our ratings matrix and return the best possible items to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the course, we learn different ways to predict unseen ratings, but the outputs remain unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.1 Prediction step\n",
    "\n",
    "The RS core computation is to predict the utility of unseen items $i \\in I \\setminus I_u$ to a user $u$.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the core, we learn a function $f$ that maps user-item pairs into ratings $f : U \\times I \\to S$ given by $\\hat{r}_{u, i} = f(u, i)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have it, there two main types of recommendations: top-$N$ and best-item.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.2 Top-*K* items\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given user $u \\in U$, we need a set of predictions $\\hat{R}_u = \\{f(u, i) : (u, i) \\in u \\times (I \\setminus I_u)\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we take a subset $L_u \\subset (I \\setminus I_u$), containing the items with the *k*-largest predicted ratings $\\hat{r}_{u, i} \\in \\hat{R}_u$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optionally, $L_u = \\{i_0, i_1, ..., i_k\\}$ can be ordered as $\\hat{r}_{u, i_0} \\geq \\hat{r}_{u, i_1} \\geq ... \\geq \\hat{r}_{u, i_k}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.3 Best-item\n",
    "\n",
    "Can be seen as a particular case of top-$K$, with $K = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the function $f(u, i)$ can be used to find the best item, such as $j = \\underset{i \\space \\in \\space I \\setminus I_u}{\\mathrm{argmax}} \\space f(u, i)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7 Context-awareness\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, some systems consider the context, alongside users and items. Take $C$ as a set of contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reasoning is that sometimes the utility for an item is observed to depend on other variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "(A very good camera, for example, may be of lesser utility for a newbie than it is for pro, for example.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In these cases, we need $f$ to use the context as well, as $f : U \\times I \\times C \\to S$ given by $\\hat{r}_{u, i, c} = f(u, i, c)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given user $u \\in U$, the predictions become $\\hat{R}_u = \\{f(u, i, c) : (u, i, c) \\in u \\times (I \\setminus I_u) \\times C\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7.1 Time\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of time as a particular case of context-aware RS, where $\\hat{r}_{u, i, t} = f(u, i, t)$."
